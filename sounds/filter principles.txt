* This filter is focused on softcore trade leaguestart, not directly HC SFF racing. An attempt was made to be compatible however.

Principles:
* Keep changes contained to FilterBlade's Leveling sections when at all possible, for clarity and possible compatibility with endgame filters.
* Any drop with a sound must have an icon, knowing where something dropped is critical to knowing whether it's worth picking up.
 * Almost every drop with an icon should have a custom sound, so it's known what dropped.
 * If it seems like a drop is not important enough for a sound or not important enough for an icon, it should probably have neither.
* Generally leave "Sound: 6" (very high tier drop), "Sound: 1" (high tier drop), and "Sound: 8" (exalt drop) as-is.
* "Color: Gray" map icons are to be avoided. Gray map icons are too difficult to see at some minimap zoom levels or transparency levels.
* All lower-case sound file names for compatibility.

Other notes:
* A warning rule for chaos recipe rare items is included as a reminder to switch filters around mid act 8.

* Text-to-speech is Amazon Polly: US English / Matthew. Polly is good TTS if you want to replace the sound files with a different voice.
